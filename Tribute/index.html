					<article> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor.
						He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.
						He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon".
						His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
						His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
						He remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

				<h3>Early Life</h3>
				<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family.
					He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564.
					His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.
					This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.
					He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.
